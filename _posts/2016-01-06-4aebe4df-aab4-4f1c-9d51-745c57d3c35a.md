Flagged Wonders

Flagged Wonders is a personal project I started with two good friends, jesus Diaz and Ramiro Silva. 

This project  wants to put the best street art in Chicago in everyone's radar. We're in a constant quest to find the coolest street art and share it with the world. Our headquarters are in Chicago, USA but we care about art all around the world.

In our website, flaggedwonders.com you will find coverage of the street art scene in our city and releases from our artist friends. We want the site to become a hub of the cool. A destination for people like us who love street art, collectors willing to exchange pieces and travellers wanting to find out about events and up coming artist both in Chicago and in the world.
